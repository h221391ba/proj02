                    (previously: Lactobacillus rhamnosus[1]) is a bacterium that originally
                    was considered to be a subspecies of L. casei, but genetic research found it to be a separate
                    species in the L. casei clade, which also includes L. paracasei and L. zeae.[2][3] It is a short
                    Gram-positive homofermentative facultative anaerobic non-spore-forming rod that often appears in
                    chains. Some strains of L. rhamnosus bacteria are being used as probiotics, and are particularly
                    useful in treating infections of the female urogenital tract, most particularly very difficult to
                    treat cases of bacterial vaginosis (or "BV").[4] The species Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus and
                    Limosilactobacillus reuteri are commonly found in the healthy female genito-urinary tract and are
                    helpful to regain control of dysbiotic bacterial overgrowth during an active infection. L. rhamnosus
                    sometimes is used in dairy products such as fermented milk and as non-starter-lactic acid bacterium
                    (NSLAB) in long-ripened cheese.[5] While frequently considered a beneficial organism, L. rhamnosus
                    may not be as beneficial to certain subsets of the population; in rare circumstances, especially
                    those primarily involving weakened immune system or infants, it may cause endocarditis.[6] Despite
                    the rare infections caused by L. rhamnosus, the species is included in the list of bacterial species
                    with qualified presumed safety (QPS) status of the European Food Safety Agency.

                L. rhamnosus is considered a nomadic organism[8] and strains have been isolated from many different
                environments including the vagina and the gastrointestinal tract. L. rhamnosus strains have the capacity
                for strain-specific gene functions that are required to adapt to a large range of environments.[9] Its
                core genome contains 2,164 genes, out of 4,711 genes in total (the pan-genome).[9] The accessory genome
                is overtaken by genes encoding carbohydrate transport and metabolism, extracellular polysaccharides,
                biosynthesis, bacteriocin production, pili production, the CRISPR-Cas system, the clustered regularly
                interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci, and more than 100 transporter functions and mobile
                genetic elements such as phages, plasmid genes, and transposons.[9]
            </p>
            <p>
                The genome of the specific strain L. rhamnosus LRB, in this case, taken from a human baby tooth,
                consists of a circular chromosome of 2,934,954 bp with 46.78% GC content.[10] This genome contains 2,749
                total genes with 2,672 that are total protein-coding sequences.[10] This sample did not contain any
                plasmids.[10] The most extensively studied strain, L. rhamnosus GG, a gut isolate, consists of a genome
                of 3,010,111 bp. Therefore, the LRB genome is shorter than GGâ€™s genome. LRB lacks the spaCBA gene
                cluster of GG and is not expected to produce functional pili (6).[10] This difference may help explain
                why each strain lives in a different habitat.

                L. rhamnosus GG (ATCC 53103) is a strain of L. rhamnosus that was isolated in 1983 from the intestinal
                tract of a healthy human being; filed for a patent on 17 April 1985, by Sherwood Gorbach and Barry
                Goldin,[11] the 'GG' derives from the first letters of their surnames.[12] The patent refers to a strain
                of "L. acidophilus GG" with American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) accession number 53103; later
                reclassified as a strain of L. rhamnosus. The patent claims the L. rhamnosus GG (ATCC 53103) strain is
                acid- and bile-stable, has a great avidity for human intestinal mucosal cells, and produces lactic acid.
                Since the discovery of the L. rhamnosus GG (ATCC 53103) strain, it has been studied extensively on its
                various health benefits and currently L. rhamnosus GG (ATCC 53103) strain is the world's most studied
                probiotic bacterium with more than 800 scientific studies.

                <p>
                    While L. rhamnosus GG (ATCC 53103) is able to survive the acid and bile of the stomach and
                    intestine,[15] is claimed to colonize the digestive tract, and to balance intestinal microbiota,
                    evidence suggests that L. rhamnosus, comparable to virtually all probiotic lactobacilli, is only a
                    transient inhabitant and not autochthonous.[16] Regardless, it is considered a probiotic useful for
                    the treatment of various maladies, as it works on many levels. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG binds to
                    the gut mucosa.

                        nosocomial diarrhea and this has been recently supported by European guidelines.[20][21][22]
                        Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG may reduce the risk of traveler's diarrhea.

            <hr>
            <p>
                L. rhamnosus GR-1 was originally found in the urethra of a healthy female and is nowadays a model strain
                for vaginal probiotics. A genome comparison between L. rhamnosus GG and L. rhamnosus GR-1 shows that
                GR-1 lacks spaCBA-encoded pili, an important adhesin in L. rhamnosus GG adhesion to the intestinal
                epithelial cells.[29] In contrast, L. rhamnosus GR-1 utilises lectin-like proteins to attach to
                carbohydrates on the surface of the target cell. Lectin-like proteins preferentially bind to
                nonkeratinized stratified squamous cells which are found in the urethra and vagina. The lectin-like
                protein 1 purified from L. rhamnosus GR-1 is found to prevent infection by the uropathogenic E. coli
                UTI89 by inhibiting its adhesion to epithelial cells and by disrupting its biofilm formation.[30]
                Additionally, it can increase biofilm formation in other beneficial lactobacilli that inhabit the
                vagina.
